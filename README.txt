This GitHUb repo will be used for projects related to md simulation such as code for md simulation and the analysis of the trajectory

Codes that will be of importance are

1. Python code for virtual screening
2. Python code for mmpbsa, i.e mmpbsa.py code for the analysis of binding affinity
3. Code for the analysis of trajectories from md simulation
